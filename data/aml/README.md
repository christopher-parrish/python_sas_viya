For financial services organizations, model developement for fraud detection and for surfacing potentially anti-money laundering activites is an area of increasing interest.

Bespoke models may be used by banks to replace rules-based scenarios or other fraud detection activities.

This use case models bank account holder activity to determine the probability of a money laundering event.

The first step in the process is to develop a model in Python using the SAS Viya Workbench Python API.

Once the model is created, it is registered to SAS Viya Model Manager to inventory and risk manage.
